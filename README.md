# DetectDuplicates

This little helper program collects the hashsums of all files (optionally recursive) in a directory. It also reports back if there are files with identical
hashsums. If wanted, duplicate files can be deleted.

## Building
Maven and JDK 8 are needed. ```mvn install```

## Running
JRE 8
